## General Information
Hello! The name of our Command Line Interface application is NBA Quiz. As the name suggests, this application lets users test their NBA knowledge directly from the command line. Cool! 

After downloading the game, users can do the following:

  1. Create an account with a username
  2. Take the quiz 
  3. See the scores of any user
  4. Delete your account
  
The entirety of the quiz is completed from the command line, or the terminal on a Mac device. All the questions in the quiz were created by the makers of this quiz, Mason Waller and Grant Ferowich. 

======================================================================================================

## Technologies 

The application is written in Ruby, so it requires Ruby on your device in order to take the quiz. These Ruby gems are needed to take the quiz [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/): 

- [bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler)
- [pry](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry)
- [activerecord](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord)
- [sqlite3](https://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3)

## Setup

Start with your terminal. First check that your system has Ruby: 
```ruby -v```
The terminal will respond with information about the version of Ruby running on your machine, so you'll see something along these lines if you have Ruby: 
```ruby 2.6.1p33 (2019-01-30 revision 66950) [x86_64-darwin18]```
Alternatively, if you need to download and install Ruby, you can do that with the [Official Ruby Language Downloads](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) page. You'll see instructions there for how to get Ruby set up on your machine! 

Next, download this repository from GitHub.

Be mindful of where you put the repo onto your computer! You'll need to change into the directory where you just downloaded the repo, like this: 

```cd your/path```

For me, that looks like this: 

```/Users/gferowich/Desktop/Mod1/module-one-final-project-guidelines-austin-web-102819```

Next, type this into the terminal and hit enter: 

```bundle install```

Finally, type the following into the terminal and hit enter again:

```ruby bin/run.rb``` 

You can now take the quiz. Enjoy!
